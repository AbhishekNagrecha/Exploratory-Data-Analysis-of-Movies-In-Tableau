# Statistical-Data-Analysis-of-IMDB-Movies-In-Tableau
In this project I utilized the IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset which I found on Kaggle.It contains 28 attributes and around 5000 tuples.One of my Primary aim was to understand relationship between 
different attributes and their co-relation with the movies box-office performance and its revenue.After careful data exploration I discovered that the it had many Null values, hence by using the Filter method in tableau i 
filled those up. For the attribute Genre I splitted it into 3 categories to get a better view.I particularly observed that movies Fb likes had a positive impact with 
the movie's performance at the box office and its IMDB ratings(greater than 5).Moreover, actors popularity on Fb also saw the similar pattern on box-office.


As far as Genre is concerened, it was observed that action movies had the maximum budget but there was one outlier in the form of comedy movies in the year 2006.
For movie ratings i discovered that over the years movies with PG-13 rating performed exceptionally well however a good trernd was also seen for R category.
Additionally, for the duration of distint Genres I found out that 'drama' had the maximum number of outliers and certain genres like 'family', 'musical', and 'animation' genres were most consistent over the years.
For all the created dashboards I used the mixture of Scatter and Box plots,Packed bubbles, Histograms, Bar, Area and Pie charts and stacked bars.
I also created a corelation matrix between varius data points to get a detailed understanding of data.
